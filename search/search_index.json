In the current time, we have revived these Pok\u00e9mon as Fossils. But after the the events of the Past, Steven Stone brought back pure DNA samples, unaffected by the fossilization process.

A good example is Aggron, becoming X's Psudo-Legendary Pok\u00e9mon with a BST of 600. There is also Pok\u00e9mon that has had minor boost like Lopunny and some with complete changes like Dusknoir. Being overshadowed by its pre-evolution with eviolite, Dusknoir usually serves no purpose. So now, when Dusclops evolves into Dusknoir, it sacrifices its normal defenses for offenses, giving it a new playstyle.</p>"},{"location":"#abilities","title":"Abilities","text":"<p>New abilities has been added to the game. Alot of them are unique abilities for Legendary and Pok\u00e9mon involved in the story. You can find them all under \"Ability Changes\" on the left side.</p> <p>Alot of new Pok\u00e9mon has had their abilities changed or added a new secondary ability.

As a few examples, Flygon is now a Bug/Dragon Pok\u00e9mon, Golduck is a Water/Psychic and Altaria is a Fairy/Dragon.</p> <p>Most Pok\u00e9mon that has had type changes is to either improve them, or change them into a typing I feel they should have had in the first place, as with Flygon. Every Starter Pok\u00e9mon has now a dual typing, like Blastoise becoming a Water/Steel. Most of the secondary typings dont appear until the final evolution.</p> <p>The Ice typing, which is a fairly bad defensive typing, has gained two new resistances in Ground and Water.</p>"},{"location":"#shiny-pokemon","title":"Shiny Pok\u00e9mon","text":"<p> We've all seen some of the less than cool shiny Pok\u00e9mon, and the older ones are excused by how they were generated in the code.

Some of them, such as Gengar, Garchomp and even the mascot, Pikachu, has pretty boring shinies. </p> <p>I decided to updated, change and modify some shiny Pok\u00e9mon I either didn't like or felt deserved a better one. If you disagree with them, that's fine, not all the new shinies are for Pok\u00e9mon with bad shinies.</p> <p>Most Starter Pok\u00e9mon has gotten a new shiny.
